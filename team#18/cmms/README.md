# ```Central Mandi Management System ( C.M.M.S )```

### Topic :- "Agriculture & Rural Development - Designing solutions keeping in mind the need to enhance the primary sector of India."

<b>Problem</b> : 

There is a huge problem related to distribution and pricing of produced good.Farmers have to suffer a great deal not just economically but also physically. In cases such as, when their product is not sold they stay back at mandi for nights and return home when the product is sold. They have no home to stay at nights, they have to sleep in trucks.There are lots and lots of problem in the current mandi system, some of them are :

* Farmers are unaware of actual price for their prodcuct

* They have to stay back at night in case their product is unsold.

* Product are sold for lesser rate because they want to sell all of their product in one go and due to lack of knowledge about the price of commodities and many more.

<b>Our Objectives</b> : 

Our objective is to make things easier for farmers to sell their respective crops at fair price.
We want to keep  transparency between the trader and the farmer, so that real profit is reached to its true owner.
Every farmer could come to know about the fair price of commodity before selling to the trader so that they can get the maximum benefit.
Not only focusing on benifit we are going to provide feauture that will help save their time and resource which are wasted while transportation and selling the product.
