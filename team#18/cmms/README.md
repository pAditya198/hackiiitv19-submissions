<b>Problem</b> : 

There is a huge problem related to distribution and pricing of produced good.Farmers have to suffer a great deal not just economically but also physically. In cases such as, when their product is not sold they stay back at mandi for nights and return home when the product is sold. They have no home to stay at nights, they have to sleep in trucks.There are lots and lots of problem in the current mandi system, some of them are :

* Farmers are unaware of actual price for their prodcuct

* They have to stay back at night in case their product is unsold.

* Product are sold for lesser rate because they want to sell all of their product in one go and due to lack of knowledge about the price of commodities and many more.
